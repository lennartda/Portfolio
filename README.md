# My Projects

This GitHub repository contains some of the projects I was contributing to. Results of further projects, such as smart basket analysis, a demand prediction, and an entire database modeling creation process could be shared on-demand. All of the projects were done mostly in Python with the support of given libraries, for instance, Pandas, sklearn, and plotly. Within the projects several of the most common algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning are implemented.

Please feel free to contact me, I am looking forward to hearing from you: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennart-dangers-6a6413169/)

### Project 1: Clustering Insurance Customers

This university group project (subject: Data Mining) deals with a given dataset by an insurance company that aims to do more precise marketing campaigns to address their customers more suitable. Among the common exploratory analysis, **clustering algorithms**, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and self-organizing maps were applied.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation Hotel

In this project (subject: Business Cases with Data Science), a hotel chain with hotels in Lisbon and the Algarve wanted to know patterns and profiles of their customers. Within this project the main focus was on the **exploratory data analysis**, the dimension reduction (here: **Principal Component Analysis**), and again **clustering methods**. The overall goal was to obtain highly interpretable results and clear **interpretations** to communicate to the hotel chain.

### Project 3: Cancellation Prediction 

Hospitality is a highly competitive market that forces hotels to offer free cancellations and therefore implement an overbooking strategy. A prediction of whether a booking is likely to be canceled can be a vital value for a hotel. In this binary classification problem the project team analyzed labeled customer data of a given 3-years period and applied classification algorithms to predict if a new booking is likely to be canceled:

- Logistic Regression 
- Neural Networks (MLPClassifier) 
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest 
- XGBoost
